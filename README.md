🐍 Python Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of Python mini projects! These projects were built to practice and demonstrate my understanding of core Python concepts including functions, conditionals, loops, file handling, and basic user interaction.

This repository serves as a portfolio of beginner-friendly projects, each designed to solve a specific problem or build a useful tool. All code is written in Python 3 and is easy to run and explore.
